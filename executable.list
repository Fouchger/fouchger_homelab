# =============================================================================
# File: executable.list
# Project: Fouchger HomeLab
# Purpose:
#   Central list of repository files that should be made executable during
#   installation (in addition to all *.sh scripts).
#
# Format:
#   - One relative path per line (relative to the repository root)
#   - Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored
#
# Notes:
#   - Keep this list stable and explicit. It gives you a single place to
#     manage executable bits even if the folder structure changes.
#   - If a path does not exist, the installer will warn and continue.
